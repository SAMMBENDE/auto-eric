          By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that participating
          dealers may not have in inventory a new vehicle that exactly matches
          any virtual vehicle you may configure on the website, and certain
          models or configurations may not be available. Your dealer will
          confirm vehicle availability, including available options and colors,
          from actual inventory. Each dealer sets and controls its own pricing.{" "}
          <br />
          You may negotiate the purchase price directly with the dealer, and
          AutoEric plays no role in that negotiation. The savings information
          communicated directly to you by a selling dealer for a vehicle
          consistent with the preferences expressed in any virtual vehicle you
          may configure may change if the actual in-stock vehicle that you
          choose to buy differs from the configuration of your virtual vehicle.
          Used vehicles are subject to prior sale.
